## Conference Call Bingo
#### The other day, a co-worker handed me a 5x5 bingo card style grid of cliches and buzz words that we all hear on conference calls from time to time. The idea is to mark the appropriate box when you hear others on your calls say them, and yell "BINGO" (preferably on mute!) when you get a row filled in. Those on the call won't know you're playing (except those on your mailing list, if any). Examples are "who just joined?", "I was on mute" and "I have a hard stop".

#### So I decided to create an ever-growing list of said tropes and use Python to, at given intervals, randomize the list; put it into a 5x5 grid; format the grid; and email it to a list of players.
