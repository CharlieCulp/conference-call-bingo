# Conference Call Bingo
The other day, a co-worker handed me a 5x5 bingo card style grid of cliches that we all hear on conference calls from time to time. The idea is to mark the appropriate box when we hear OTHERS say them, and yell "bingo" (preferably on mute!) when we get a row filled in. Examples are "who just joined?", "I was on mute" and "I have a hard stop".

So I decided to create an ever-growing list of conference call tropes, and use Python to randomize it, build a new grid, format it and email it at given intervals. It's now complete. I just need to schedule it.
