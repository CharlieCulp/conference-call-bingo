# Conference Call Bingo
The other day, a co-worker handed me a 5x5 bingo card style grid of cliches that we all hear on conference calls from time to time. The idea is to mark the appropriate box when we hear OTHERS say them, and yell "bingo" (preferably on mute!) when we get a row filled in. Examples are "who just joined?", "I was on mute", "I have a hard stop" and "will you/ I will reach out to".

So I decided to expand the list and use Python to randomize it, create new grids, format them and email them out each day/week. I still need to add the last part.
